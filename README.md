# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

    The purpose of the project was to create a tectonic plates' location using earthquake data with a 
    magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. Also, created data on third map.

    This was accomplished using knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data and github. The 
    main objective was to:
      
###	Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file

###	Made API requests to a server to host geographical maps.

###	Geographical map was populated  with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven     

###	Documents (D3) library.

###	Added multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet

###	Used JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.

   ## Results
    
    ###  Added  Tectonic Plate Data
